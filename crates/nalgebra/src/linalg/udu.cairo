//! `UDUᵀ` factorisation `p = u·diag(d)·uᵀ` of a symmetric matrix — `u` unit UPPER
//! triangular, `d` a vector — unrolled for the static sizes 2, 3, 4 and 6 (upstream
//! `nalgebra::linalg::UDU`).
//!
//! The kernel is the crate-internal `LDLᵀ` factorisation of `crate::linalg::ldlt`, applied to the
//! reversed matrix `J·p·J` (`J` the reversal permutation): the two factorisations are the same
//! algorithm read backwards, so `UDU::new(p)` costs the `LDLᵀ` kernel plus moves. The public
//! surface is exactly upstream's: the fields `u` and `d`, `new` and `d_matrix` (WP 8.0: the
//! `LDLᵀ` `l`, `solve`, `inverse` and `determinant`, which upstream's `UDU` does not have, are
//! crate-internal).
